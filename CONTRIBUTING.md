Here are the simple steps for contributing to this repo

  - **READ CODE OF CONDUCT**
     
     Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clubgamma/code-of-conduct) before starting contributing.

  - **Fork the repo**
    
    First of all fork the repo to your own GitHub account by clicking the **Fork** button on top-right corner. Still could not find 🙄,check the below image
    ![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58077762/93772626-ac77ef80-fc3c-11ea-8ee6-e381e1d68280.png)
    After a sucessful fork, you'll see a copy of this repo in your own account.

  - **Clone the repo**
    
    Now it's time to copy this repo to own laptop/PC. 
    To clone the repo you can write the below command in **Git Bash**
    
    > git clone <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
    
    You can get the repo link from the Download section in the **repo copied in your own account**. Still having trouble🙄,see the below image
    
    ![clone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58077762/93773696-fad9be00-fc3d-11ea-8981-5f6b31cefee1.png)
    
  - **Set up remote repo**
    
      - When you cloned your fork, that should have automatically set your fork as the "origin" remote. Use git remote -v to show your current remotes. You should see the URL of your fork (which you copied in step 3) next to the word "origin". 
        If you don't see an "origin" remote, you can add it using below git command
    
        > git remote add origin <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
      
      - Now you have to setup **upstream**. For that write the below git command
      
        > git remote add upstream https://github.com/clubgamma/Awesome-Flutter-Art
        
      - Now pull the latest changes from original repo to your local changes by firing thee below command
        
        > git pull upstream master
            
  - **It's Flutter Time now**
    
      - First of all, make a folder with named as your GitHub username and this is compulsory.

      - After that start writing code inside that folder only and you know what you have to code😉. Create anything you want using Flutter only!!
      
      ![foldercontent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58077762/93989598-b9fdb880-fda7-11ea-8593-fb9523a367a8.png)
      
      - After finishing with the coding part, take snapshots of your creations or make a GIF if you have made any kind of animation✨✨. 
      
        Add the snapshot/GIF under the **Art-Work** section in the [README.md](https://github.com/clubgamma/Awesome-Flutter-Art/blob/master/README.md) in the same manner displayed in below image.

  - **Now it's time to save the work**
      
      - Stage the changes you have made by firing the below command
        > git add -A
        
      - Create a new branch while you commit the changes
      
      - Commit your all files in that branch
        > git commit -m "Description of changes/your work"
  
  - **Let's finish this**
  
      - Go to your forked repo on GitHub website and refresh the page, you'll see something like the below image
